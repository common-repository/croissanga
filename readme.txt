Croissanga is a WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to add, edit, and delete your Xanga posts directly from WordPress.

== Description ==

Croissanga is a WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to add, edit, and delete your Xanga posts directly from WordPress.  This is often called 'cross-posting.'  You need a Xanga account to use this plugin.

Croissanga's home on the web can be found at [http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/](http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/)

Please inform [me](http://ryanlee.org/) of any global configuration variables it would help you to have in case something like a drastic upgrade occurs again.

== Installation ==

See INSTALL for more.  In a word: upload the croissanga/ directory to your plugins directory and activate it.  You must have the PHP CURL module installed.

Previous versions did not have editing and deleting functions built in.  You will have to replace your old plugin file; if you hacked on it, I'm sorry.

Croissanga version 1.2 was written for WordPress 1.5.  It is not backwards compatible with WordPress 1.2.

Croissanga version 1.3 was written for WordPress 2.2.2.  I am not aware of its backwards compatibility; earlier WordPress versions have security issues.
