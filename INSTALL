INSTALLATION

  This is a one step process.  This pertains to Croissanga, version 1.3
  and up.

  Step 0: PHP CURL

  Make sure PHP CURL is installed.  Check the output of phpinfo(), ask
  your service admin, etc.


  Step 1: Upload the plugin

  The plugin files are listed in README.  Non-functioning files are named
  in all caps; the other files must be in a croissanga/ directory, and
  that must be in your WordPress plugin/ directory (read again: it MUST
  be named croissanga).


  Step 2: Activate and configure

  Go to your plugin management page and activate Croissanga.  You will now
  have a 'Croissanga' submenu under 'Options' from which you can configure
  Croissanga.

  Make sure you fill out the Xanga username and password in the options
  section or Croissanga will not operate.


  That's it!
